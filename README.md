# Decoy School Coronavirus Timetables

## Timetabling for staff and the children of key workers

Simple webapp to parse data from Google sheets to display staff availabilty by day, and which children of key workers would like to attend school, for which sessions, each day. Built with [svelte](svelte.dev) and [firebase](firebase.google.com).

To do:

- ~~work out how to pull all existing data from spreadsheet~~
- ~~decide how to parse and display data - by day?~~
- look at bug were updates are appended to an array rather than re-writing it
- deploy to netlify
- styling (BASIC!)
- loading/async states (BASIC!)
- think about workflow for adding upcoming weeks
